OPServ
======

Welcome to the BWC - OpServ Hackshop program.  Here we'll be working on multiple projects for the BWC, all of which have to do with the OpServ.  If you're interested in providing input or support to the code/programming discussed here, please contact Rohan.  

Current Project
======

Currently, we're working on optimizing the AAR page, to make it more functional for users who run large scale operations.  At the same time, we want these functions to be solid and fool proof.  For more details on this project, view: http://the-bwc.com/smf/index.php?topic=63413
